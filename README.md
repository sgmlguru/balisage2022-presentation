# README

This contains slides for me and Jean's Balisage 2022 presentation. 


## Prererequisites

The slides require [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) to run. I've cloned the whole thing to my `repos` folder as a sibling to this repository. It looks like this:

```
.
├...
├── balisage2022-db2html
├...
├── reveal.js
├...

67 directories, 1 file

```


## Running

Update the links in `index.html` to point at your *reveal.js* install (or git clone). Open the file in a browser.

**NOTE!** A slightly more complex approach is to replace the example `repos/reveal.js/index.html` with a symbolic link to `ìndex.html` in this repository and then run the reveal.js server (see the instructions in the reveal.js README). This adds a few features
